# When-the-haipai-cry
We here from >The ""Winning"" Team, are proud to present part two of our award winning visual novel series. When The Haipai Cry: Healing Arc. This is the first ever mahjongsoul lesbian dating sim. Join Keiku in her rosy high school days and go on dates with Yui, Sprout, Nana, and Xenia. We even have some original artwork for the yuri scenes. 
I'd like to thank all of my team mates for putting in so much blood and sweat into this visual novel. Let's be honest, we had to do something big to make up for coming in second place. 
Do keep in mind that this is a sequel to the original When the Tiles Cry. While you can read this without playing the original, I would recommend reading that first if you haven't already.
