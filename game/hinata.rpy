    k "It’s me, Keikumusume, from the mahjong club. I was wondering if you’d like to hang out after school today. We don’t have club on, after all."
    h "Ah, this is perfect timing! I actually need some help with the school garden. Would you be able to come on down right now?"
    k "I’d be happy to!"

    k "Oh, sure."
    k "1, 2, 3!"
    k "(What the hell, even with two people this is so heavy!)"
    k "(Just moving it this short distance is a pain in the backside.)"
#    {Play some sort of thud sound effect for the sound of the mulch bag being dropped}
    k "Phew. Shouldn’t this be a job for the boys in your club?"
    h "Club? There’s no club. It’s actually just me."
    k "Wait really? You do all this by yourself?"
    k "(I never really noticed it before, but these school gardens are actually really extensive.)"
    k "(There’s some gorgeous hydrangeas, mushroom boxes, rows of vegetables and berries, a patch of lavender, and even a rose bush.)"
    h "Well, I wouldn’t say it’s all me. Of course nature does a lot of the work on its own."
    k "That’s still really incredible though."
    h "I do appreciate hearing that. Although I honestly think it could be a lot better."
    h "For example, I’d like to grow melons. Big juicy melons."
    h "But doing that really isn’t feasible on my own. It requires a lot of soil work to grow watermelons."
    h "They need lots of mulching, raised beds, and constant watering."
    h "I feel limited, because I can only do so much on my own."
    h "Like these flowers right here. The poor things are starting to wilt because I’ve gotten a little slack in watering them."
    k "I see. Well I can help out for today at least. Let’s give it our all."

    k "(Me and Hinata both worked hard.)"
    k "(Although honestly I feel like all I really did was carry stuff. I really don’t know what I’m doing when it comes to garden stuff.)"
    k "(Every movement she makes with the plants looks so precise. It’s like she knows the exact correct distance to put between seeds when she puts them into the soil.)"
    k "(The way she gently pats the soil down on top of them, it’s like she’s taking care of a baby.)"
    h "It’ll be getting dark soon. So I think we’ve done enough..."
    k "(Finally. Doesn’t this girl get tired?)"
    k "So what did we actually accomplish today? Come to think of it, I never asked what we were planting."
    h "Strawberries. Once they’ve finished growing I’ll share them all with the club."
    h "You’ve been a big help today. I wouldn’t have been able to plant anywhere near as many as we did if you weren’t around."
    k "I feel like I was just the muscle, but I don’t mind."
    k "How’d you get so into gardening anyway?"
    k "For some reason, at first glance I got more of an artist vibe from you."
    h "Everyone always says that and I don’t understand why. Maybe it’s the beret?"
    h "Anyway, my house has a big backyard in it. My parents are often away on business trips and stuff, so I didn’t have a whole lot to do on holidays."
    h "So I did gardening work. I’d set myself projects and stuff, and I’d pass the weeks watching the plants grow."
    k "Couldn’t you have just like, watched movies or something? What was the appeal?"
    h "I guess it’s the satisfaction of watching something grow. Raising a tiny seed into a fully grown plant and knowing that it lives because you nurtured it."
    h "Cooking also tastes better when you’re using your own herbs and stuff too."
    h "I think if you did a blind taste test or something like that, I wouldn’t notice the difference. But when you’ve put hard work into something, the payoff is made a lot sweeter."
    k "I see, I see. I can definitely see the appeal of gardening now."
    h "It always used to shock my parents whenever they came home and they saw how big the plants had gotten."
    h "A tiny seed growing into a fully sized plant in the blink of an eye."
    k "Yeah that does sound kind of shocking. Like if you just left a seed and came back a little bit later and there was a fully grown tree in the empty space there. That’d be weird."
    k "Anyway, thanks for letting me help out. It was a lot of fun."
    h "Mhm. I’ll be sure to give you a big share of the strawberries. See you tomorrow!"
