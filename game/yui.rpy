    k "Wait, we're watching a movie now?"
    y "Did you want to do something else? You didn't mention any plans so I assumed it would be fine."
    k "Well I didn't actually have any plans so I don't see anything wrong with it."

    k "That movie was actually really good."
    y "You liked it?"
    k "Yeah, I thought it was just going to be like a toy commercial, but I got really invested in the main character."
    k "(Although it is honestly still a toy commercial.)"
    k "(Wait a minute, is she staring at me? Has she been staring at me this entire time?)"
    y "Ah, that's really good. I wasn't sure if you'd like it."
    k "I really did! But, you're a little too close to me."
    y "..."
    y "Ah! I'm sorry! I'm really sorry. I just really wanted to see if you were enjoying it or not."
    k "Oh. Well, I guess that's fine then."
    k "(I mean it’s not fine, but I don’t want to spurn good intentions.)"
    y "Let's watch the next one now."
    k "Aaaah wait wait. There's no way I have time for all three of them on a school night."
    y "...oh, you should have said so. That's fine."
    y "By the way, I want to apologise to you."
    y "Yesterday in the club you said that you hoped we wouldn't expect much from you in the weekend tournament, and I said I wouldn't."
    y "I simply wanted to reaffirm that I wouldn't expect much from you because you told us not to."
    y "I didn't think that it would be something that could offend someone. Please disregard what I said. I expect you to do really well."
    k "(Wait, is she bowing?)"
    y "As a token of my apology, please accept this chocolate I bought."
    k "(This is a little weird, but I don't think she's malicious.)"
    k "Well I do think you're overreacting a bit, but I'll gladly accept it."
    y "Ah, I'm overreacting? I'm sorry."
    k "There’s no need to apologise twice."
    y "There's no need for that? Ah well, I'm sorry for that too."
    k "(Ah, this conversation seems like it’s just stuck in a loop.)"
    k "(Call up the scientists, we’ve discovered a perpetual motion machine.)"
    k "Well, there's no need to worry about it. See you tomorrow at school."
    y "Yep. Goodbye. Thank you very much for coming over."
