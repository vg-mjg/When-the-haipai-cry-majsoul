    n "Yo! Who’s this?"
    k "Oh, it’s me, Keikumusume."
    n "Ah, the new girl! What’s up?"
    k "Well, I’ve got nothing on tonight, so I was wondering if you’d want to hang out."
    n "You’ve called with great timing."
    n "I was actually planning on doing some fencing, but my usual partner for that is away sick today."
    n "Until you called up I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to do it today."
    n "Meet me in the gym asap!"
    k "(Wait, fencing? Isn’t that the sport with the swords? I didn’t think she would just invite me to something like that right off the bat.)"

    n "Keiku, have you ever done this before?"
    k "Nope. I don’t know the rules at all. What am I meant to be doing here?"
    n "It’s simple. You just try to hit the other person with the end of the blade."
    k "How do you tell when a point is scored?"
    n "Each blade has a button on the end of it. When it gets pushed against another person, it plays a big buzzer sound."
    k "Isn’t this dangerous? Aren’t there safety precautions or something that we should be going over?"
    n "Nah. Look, they bend to soften the impact. Totally harmless."
    n "First to ten points wins. Get ready!"
#    {play schwing sound effect, then buzzer.}
    n "Point one to me~"
    k "(S-she’s fast!)"
#    {Play clank then schwing sound effect}
    n "Nice work! You’ve only just started, but you already figured out what a parry is. Although you’re still a little too slow."
    k "(Damnit, when she talks like that, I really want to beat her!)"
#    {Play continuous sword clanging noises}
    k "(Kgh, she’s so fast!)"
    k "(But I’m starting to get the hang of this. I can keep up with her!)"
#    {Play BZZT sound}
    k "(Ah! She got me again!)"
    n "Honestly, you’re learning pretty quick. You only just started, but it looks like you’ve intuitively worked out the proper way to space your feet already."

    k "(She keeps complimenting me whenever she scores, but I can’t get a hit on her at all.)"
    k "(I’m not sure if that’s encouraging or just annoying.)"
    k "(I think that there’s only one way I’m going to get a hit on her...)"
    k "(...and that’s to engage in some unconventional tactics!)"
    n "Are you ready? This will finish it off!"
    k "(Here she comes, she’s charging in like usual…)"
    k "Nana, behind you, WATCH OUT!"
    n "Huh?"
    k "Gotcha!"
#    {BZZT}
    k "(I can’t believe that worked!)"
    n "Aaaaaa, I can’t believe I fell for that. What a dirty trick."
    k "Sorry, is that frowned upon in fencing? Can’t blame a novice for not knowing."
    n "Hehe, that’s fine. All’s fair in love and war after all."
    n "9-1! Next bout! Go!"
    k "(I doubt that last technique is going to work again, but there’s still no way I’ll be able to take her head on.)"
    k "(I can see how she attacks now. She always points high! Like she’s aiming for the head.)"
    k "(I think it’s called a lunge? When she leaps forwards with her arm outstretched, like a scorpion stinging its prey.)"
    k "(Honestly, it’s kind of beautiful in a way. She’s so fast. The form is perfect. You can tell she’s practiced it a lot.)"
    k "(But today that’s going to be her downfall.)"
#    {play thud noise}
#    {BZZT}
    n "What!"
    n "I don’t believe it. You dived right onto the floor. You went prone just as I lunged, and ducked under the blade."
    n "That’s ridiculous, but it worked."
    k "(I won’t be caught by those lunges anymore. This is it, it’s time for my counter attack!)"
    k "(Next I’m going to do something even more ridiculous.)"
    k "(Nana called this a blade, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.)"
    k "(A blade is designed for cutting and slicing things.)"
    k "(But in this game, you score so long as the button on the tip pushes against your opponent.)"
    k "(So in truth, this isn’t a blade at all!)"
    k "(It’s a javelin!)"
#    {woosh sound effect}
#    {BZZT}
    n "What the hell! You can’t throw your blade at someone, that’s against the rules."
    k "Sorry, but all I remember about the rules was being told that I score whenever my blade’s tip pushes against my opponent!"
    n " . . . "
    n "Ahahaha, I guess I can’t argue with that."
    k "3-9!"
    k "(This time, I’m going to counter that same lunge again.)"
    k "(I’ve got an absolutely ingenious strategy too. I’ll simply hold my blade in front of me, and then she’ll jump into it!)"
    n "Uwooooooooh!"
    k "(Here it is, her lunge! I’ll just hold my blade out like this and…)"
    k "(Wait, she’s not pointing the tip at me?)"
    k "(She just forced my blade out of the way!)"
#    {BZZT}
    n "Those were some fancy tricks, but they weren’t going to beat good old fashioned practice."
    n "GG. Well played."
    k "D-don’t think this means you’ve won!"
    k "We’re going again!"

    n "That’s fine, that’s fine! It doesn’t matter if you’re good or not. What matters to me is just that you gave it a go."
    n "I wouldn’t have been able to play at all if you weren’t here."
    n "Also, you’ve never done this before, so it would have been really embarrassing if I lost."
    k "Couldn’t you have just joined the fencing club if you wanted to do this?"
    n "No way. It’s like I said before. I can’t commit to any clubs other than the mahjong club."
    n "So I just do this stuff whenever I happen to have the time."
    k "Why’s the mahjong club the exception then?"
    n "Well, the mahjong club is a little less maintenance, and I could potentially make a career out of it."
    n "Also, I actually find it to be the most fun out of all the sports clubs. Also there isn’t a skateboarding club."
    k "Hmm, I see."
    n "Anyway, I have study to do now. I’ll catch ya later."
