    k "This forest is pretty dense. Aren’t you worried about getting lost, Xenia?"
    x "Don’t worry, I know this forest pretty well."
    x "My family actually owns this land."
    k "Wow, seriously? This whole forest? How much land does your family own?"
    x "Uhhhh."
    x "Lots."
    x "I find this walkway quite nostalgic."
    x "I played here a lot as a kid. So even at night, I know this place like the back of my hand."
    x "I miss those days. I didn’t have to worry about how I would be representing the family's image or things like that."
    x "When you’re a little kid, you can say whatever you want and people will just write it off as a kid being a kid."
    x "But I feel like I need to constantly watch myself when I’m around my family. I’m always putting on a face for them."
    x "Hanging out with you and the mahjong club are the only times when I get to feel like I’m me."
    k "I’m glad that we can do that much for you at least."
    k "I think I used to feel similarly."
    k "Not because I had to hide any parts of myself."
    k "But because I don’t think I really had a sense of who I was in the first place."
    k "Before becoming a mahjong detective, and before joining the club, I was just the girl who sat and read books in silence."
    k "Always taking in the stories of other people, but never living my own stories."
    k "You can’t express your true self if there’s nothing there to express in the first place."
    k "In comparison to that sort of life, going out like this is really exciting."
    k "Even though we’re basically just going for a walk, my heart is racing."
    x "I absolutely agree with you. Adventures like this develop character. We can’t develop if we’re just locked inside all day."
    k "Exactly."
    k "Oh yeah, Xenia, I have to ask this."
    k "Why are you still wearing such a fancy outfit? Aren’t you worried about it getting muddy?"
    x "{size=-10}Because there weren’t any assets of me in camping clothes for the developers to steal.{/size}"
    k "Huh? I didn’t hear that."
    x "Like I said, I know this forest well already, and it’s not like it’s raining."
    x "Why are you wearing that hat on a night time camping trip? It’s not like you need to protect yourself from the sun."
    k "This hat is just special to me is all."
    k "Hats are an old tradition in my family."
    k "It belonged to my great grandparents, who passed it down to my grandparents, who passed it down to my parents, who passed it on to my uncle, who left it to me."
    k "So I wear it to remember them all. It’s like I’m able to take them wherever I go."
    k "I know you’re not that fond of your family, but it’s important to remember that they’re the only family you’ve got."
    k "Once they’re gone, that’s it."
    x "Keiku..."
    k "Ah, I’m sorry. I don’t want to sound like I’m accusing you of anything."
    x "No, it’s fine. Maybe it’s true that I should appreciate them a little more."
    x "I think I might have a better perspective on that when I’m older."
    x "Maybe when I become an independent adult I’ll miss it."
    x "Or perhaps if I ever have to look after a child, I’ll understand."
    x "It’s easy to complain about not being able to do certain things, or having to take extra lessons at home."
    x "But perhaps from their perspective they want to protect me or help me grow into the finest person I can be."
    k "Well, I definitely think they’re a bit overzealous. But I don’t think it necessarily comes from a bad place."
    k "I mean, not letting your daughter go on a little camping trip is a bit ridiculous. They definitely should tone it down."
    k "I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m lecturing you or anything like that."
    x "Nah, it’s fine. I like you, and I appreciate whatever you have to say."
    x "We’re here, by the way. This is the spot we’re going to use to pitch our tent."

    k "This is beautiful."
    k "Your family owns a whole lake?"
    x "Haha, it’s not really a lake. It just looks bigger than it really is during the night time."
    k "You can see the full moon reflected in it. It’s so beautiful."
    x "Yeah, it really is a nice night, isn’t it?"
    x "I’m going to pitch the tent up now."
    k "Ah, let me help."
    k "So this pole goes here… stick this in like that…"
    k "Why won’t this bit connect properly?"
    k "Xenia, is it supposed to be all loose like this?"
    x "Let me handle it, Keiku. This trip wouldn’t be happening without you, so let me take care of this while you take a rest."
    k "(I guess it’s fine to let her handle it, then.)"
    k "(At first glance you’d assume she’d be too pampered to do anything on her own, but she goes out of her way to do things by herself.)"
    k "(That’s a good quality.)"
    k "(The moon really does look beautiful tonight.)"
    k "(The way it casts that silver light across the water and gently lights up the flowers around the clearing is so pretty.)"
    k "(I wouldn’t mind camping out here with her forever.)"
    k "(Or at least I wouldn’t if it wasn’t so cold!)"

    k "I know earlier I said that this tent looked small, but somehow it feels a lot bigger when you’re actually inside it."
    k "It’s like the tent is its own little world."
    x "Indeed. It’s one of the coziest parts of camping."
    k "So what happens now? Do we just go to sleep?"
    x "Hmmm. Well, you can, if you want to. But personally, I don’t feel like it. If we came all this way just to sleep, we could have just stayed in bed."
    k "Yeah, we can’t just waste time sleeping."
    x "To be honest with you, I got so excited about coming out here that I didn’t think about what we were actually going to do."
    x "We’ve got the torches and plenty of battery, but we can’t exactly go exploring in the middle of the night like this."
    k "So do we just stay in this tent?"
    x "I suppose so."
    x "Keiku, can I ask you something?"
    k "Go ahead."
    x "Do you love me?"
    k "(Wow, that was upfront.)"
    k "(But that makes it a lot easier for me.)"
    k "Yeah, I love you."
    k "I love how spontaneous you are. Like how this entire trip that got decided on a whim. If I were in your position, I wouldn’t have been brave enough to sneak out. I love that."
    k "I love everything about you, Xenia. Do you love me?"
    x "Of course I love you, Keiku. I wouldn’t have asked you if I didn’t."
    x "I love how you listened to my stupid complaints and that you were willing to come out here with me at the last minute. I love just being around you."
    x "Of course I consider the other girls in the club to be my friends, but I don’t feel connected to them like I do with you."
    x "Wouldn’t it be nice to run away together permanently?"
    k "I was going to say that it’s impossible, but yeah, we could do that."
    k "I already have my own place I inherited from my uncle, and I’m guaranteed work in the MCD after I graduate."
    x "Wait, are you serious? I can just move in with you?"
    x "Hmmmmmm."
    x "I’d like to, but I don’t think I could just abandon my family so easily."
    k "Hehehe, that’s fine, I wasn’t expecting you to just drop everything and move in with a girl you’d only known for a week."
    k "But just for tonight, you and I can have this whole world to ourselves."
    x "Let’s make tonight a night to remember."
