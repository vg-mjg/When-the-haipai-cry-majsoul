    k "Ah, are you um, are you busy?"
    x "Oh, Keiku. Yes, unfortunately I am quite busy right now."
    k "Ah, that’s okay then. Don’t worry about it."
    x "It’s fine. What were you calling about?"
    k "Ah, well, I was actually just calling to ask if you wanted to hang out today."
    x "Oh absolutely, I’d love to."
    k "Huh? Didn’t you just say that you were busy?"
    x "I was busy. But now I can use this as a reason to not be busy."
    x "My father's having some colleagues from his business over this afternoon, and he wants me to come in and make conversation with them and stuff."
    k "(I don’t understand why they’d need her around his work colleagues. I guess the world of business and wealth is just incomprehensible for people like me.)"
    x "So having you come over gives me a great excuse to get out of it. Come on over."
    x "Oh, but you’ll have to get changed first. My family won’t approve if I bring someone home wearing something like that hat."
    x "Please don’t be offended. It’s not something that’s up to me."
    k "(WOW.)"
    k "(This hat is a family heirloom! It’s been passed down for generations.)"
    k "(It’s not her fault though. I guess it can’t be helped.)"
    k "Alright, I’ll see you there."

    x "Ah, thank you so much for coming. Please make yourself at home."
    k "Wow, this bedroom is huge. I can’t believe you have a couch in your room, and such a fancy TV."
    x "Yes, well, the family certainly comes with perks."
    k "What sort of work does your family actually do?"
    x "They’re big in the mahjong business. They sell luxury sets."
    x "The kind with gold bars for riichi sticks, chuns with rubies embedded in them, hatsus imbued with emerald, and hakus made of pure platinum."
    x "Ah, it’s so sickening, don’t you think? All a mahjong set needs is old fashioned wood."
    k "Hm, yeah, I think you might be right. It all seems sorta wasteful. Why do people even buy this stuff?"
    x "Status, of course. People buy it so that other people know they’re rich enough to afford it."
    x "In fact, those diamonds they embed in the eyes on the souzu birds aren’t even particularly rare. But people still buy them just because they’re expensive."
    k "Still, it must be nice to be rich even in spite of that."
    k "Like, if people wanted to buy useless junk from me for millions of dollars, I’d totally do it!"
    x "Hmmm, I suppose so. Having ‘stuff’ is nice indeed."
    x "Being able to afford things is nice. But there’s a lot of expectations that come with living in a family like this you know."
    x "I have to constantly be on guard in public, ‘for the good of the family image.’"
    x "Like, I can’t go outside wearing just a regular pair of jean shorts, it has to be a nice dress and of course it has to fit within the family definition of what’s ‘appropriate.’"
    x "Can you believe they actually get the maid to measure the length of the skirts I buy? I can’t even wear anything below the knee in summer."
    x "You know what I’d like to wear most of all? A swimsuit. Begone wetsuits."
    k "Wow, I guess being rich isn’t that great after all."
    x "I mean, being rich is pretty great, not gonna lie. It’s all the expectations I hate."
    x "Please don’t misunderstand me. I know that I’m in a very privileged position."
    x "You know, Keiku, I actually really appreciate you listening to me ramble on about this."
    x "If I told any of the other girls at school, they’d probably just be like ‘woooooow, look at the rich girl, complaining about all the MONEY she has. What a teeeeeeerrible dilemma!’"
    x "Enough about me though. What about you? What does your family do? I understand that you’re a mahjong detective, did you get the title from one of your relatives?"
    k "Yep, I come from a long line of mahjong detectives."
    k "But due to various circumstances, I’m the only one left."
    k "My parents died when I was younger, and my uncle looked after me."
    k "But he died recently. I don’t even know how or why."
    x "Ah, I’m sorry to hear that, and I’m sorry I brought it up."
    k "No, it’s fine. I don’t mind it."
    k "But listening to you talk, I have to guess there is a small upside. I can do whatever I want."
    x "Hah. I guess that is one way of looking at it."
    x "Enough of this depressing talk. Let’s do something fun. I’ve got some champagne hidden in the closet."
    k "Wow, your parents let you have champagne?"
    x "Emphasis on the hidden, dear."
    x "Cheers."
#    {Play a glug glug glug sound effect}
    k "Wow, this is, this is really something."
    k "(Honestly I can’t really tell the difference between this and the normal white wine that Watson used to let me sip. They both taste just as bitter.)"
    x "Heh. I honestly don’t even like the taste of this that much."
    k "You’re right, I feel like gagging it up whenever I drink it."
    k "Get me another glass anyway!"

    k "Xenia, I think I get it now."
    k "Drinking with someone else really improves the flavour, y’know’what’I’m’sayin?"
    x "Indeed! In fact to add on to that, one might even say that the fact that we’re not allowed to do this makes it taste even better."
    k "Yeah, yeah! It’s like, this champagne is a uhhhh, what’s the word, a forbidden fruit."
    x "A fermented forbidden fruit."
    k "Yeah, yeah that’s it."
    k "You know, before I didn’t know why adults drank this stuff."
    k "But now I get it. I get it I get it. It’s because you drink this, and you just forget about all the things you were worried about."
    k "I should take some of this stuff before giving class presentations at school."
    x "You know, I’ve done that before actually. Works wonders."
    x "You have to find the right balance though. Too much and you’ll be stumbling all over your words."
    x "Although at the time you probably won’t even care."
    x "Frankly, I don’t know why people pay for therapists when we’ve got alcohol."
    k "Hahaha, yeah, this is way better than any counsellor."
    k "(Does Xenia have wobbly floorboards or something? I feel like I could tip over…)"
    "*thud*"
    k "Owwww, my head."
    x "Oh dear, I should have realised your tolerance would be lower than mine. You didn’t grow up on this stuff."
    k "No, no, I’m definitely fine!"
    x "You can barely walk. I’ll call for a taxi to take you home."
    x "It’s a shame we have to cut the night short, I’ve really had a lot of fun."
